                    where applicable at the end of transcripts for free. We also deliver transcripts via e-mail for

                <p>I am a big believer in efficiency and know legal costs happen usually when people can least afford
                    it. Legal costs
                    affect everyone in different ways. Being able to hyperlink authority makes it much more accessible
                    to the general
                    public reading these transcripts as well as saves courts and attorneys time (money) from not having
                    to stop to look
                    it up themselves or hand it off to staff to look up all the citations in the transcript. Couple
                    minutes here, couple
                    minutes there, it really adds up quicker than one might think. It also puts arguments in a certain
                    context in the
                    moment.</p>

                    extensive amount

                    important. The database is completely offline. It does things like produce condensed versions and
                    word indexes,
                    insert TC entries, some hyperlinks, and TA entries in the transcript, and many, many other tasks,
                    which means more

                <section class="stackedRows">
                    <p>This is just a general explainer. Some states have different rules/processes to avoid problems
                        listed
                        here, and this
                        is not intended to go into that much detail.</p>
                </section>
                <section class="stackedRows">
                    <p>The biggest difference is mainly the method in which the record is taken. With stenography, a
                        person
                        comes in with a
                        stenography machine, like you might see in the movies, who has been trained in stenography for
                        18 to
                        24 months, and
                        takes the record down. They may possibly have a single microphone at their table in the
                        courtroom as
                        a back-up
                        record, purchased by the stenographer. All equipment is purchased and maintained by the
                        stenographer.</p>
                </section>
                <section class="stackedRows">
                    <p>The stenographer keeps the record made and there is generally no back-up stored with the court.
                        If
                        something happens
                        to the stenographer or the record they took, there's no other record or third party from which
                        to
                        obtain a
                        transcript of the proceedings.</p>
                </section>
                <section class="stackedRows">
                    <p>If you don't schedule a stenographer to come to your proceedings, then there will be no record of
                        it.
                        Further, most but not every stenographer records audio as a back-up, so what the stenographer
                        says
                        happened is what
                        happened and there isn't as much of an opportunity to question the accuracy of the transcript as
                        there is with the
                        second method I'm about to describe. Generally speaking, you will not be allowed to buy or
                        purchase
                        a copy of the
                        stenographer's notes or audio they recorded themselves because it is their work product.</p>

                <section class="stackedRows">
                    <p>If you want a copy, you have to buy the full transcript. Frequently, these stenographers
                        sometimes
                        will be 'tied' to
                        or work for a particular judge and receive some of their salary from the state. Stenographers
                        will
                        frequently charge
                        an appearance, a flat fee, just for showing up, not including the charge for the transcript
                        itself.

                <section class="stackedRows">
                    <p>With transcription, the process is a little bit different. With transcription, the record is
                        electronically recorded
                        by a court monitor or clerk who is paid usually an hourly rate by the court to monitor
                        audio-recorded proceedings,
                        note speakers, take down appearances, and things like this in something called reporter's notes
                        or a
                        reporter's log.

                <section class="stackedRows">
                    <p>The courts who use this method record all proceedings that happen in their court, regardless if
                        they
                        need a
                        transcript of it or not, and keep the log or notes as well as the audio, have their own storage
                        process. The court
                        purchases and maintains all recording equipment. There are usually, in any given courtroom, four
                        microphones around
                        the courtroom; one for each of the witness, judge, and two counsel tables. The audio will have
                        four
                        corresponding
                        channels, each of which you can isolate to hear what they're saying.</p>

                <section class="stackedRows">
                    <p>Then, if the transcript is necessary, someone, such as a party appealing, can order a transcript
                        of
                        it from a
                        transcriber, usually from a list of transcribers approved by that particular court. In some
                        jurisdictions, the audio
                        has to be transmitted directly from the court to the transcriber; in others, it doesn't. Once a
                        party orders, then
                        the transcriber will transcribe the proceedings.</p>
                </section>
                <section class="stackedRows">
                    <p>The transcriber only purchases and maintains equipment they need to transcribe, which is usually
                        just
                        a regular
                        computer and keyboard, although you can see how these two methods can overlap in some ways. For
                        example, a
                        stenographer can hook up their steno machine to a computer and transcribe audio recorded via the
                        second method.
                        Unlike the stenographer, the transcriber receives all their income from transcript orders only
                        and
                        this is part of
                        the overall cost savings of a transcriber as opposed to a stenographer. A stenographer can do
                        the
                        job of a
                        transcriber, but for the reasons described here, a transcriber cannot do the job of a
                        stenographer,
                        since their
                        roles are slightly different.</p>

                <section class="stackedRows">
                    <p>In addition, there is a huge shortage of stenographers nationwide, so courts have been somewhat
                        forced by
                        circumstances to adopt the second method. Places that have a strong stenographer lobby (CA, TX,
                        others) tend to shy
                        as much as they can from adopting the second method.</p>

                <section class="stackedRows">
                    <p>Now, AQC wants to be clear. We're transcribers. This has been written from that point of view.
                        There
                        are a lot of
                        upsides to transcribing, such as the ability to infinitely listen to a proceeding over and over.
                        It's also usually
                        cheaper because there is a greater incentive to be competitive, as there is no monopoly on who
                        holds
                        the official
                        audio/notes/log record with the second method. You can review the proceedings via audio before
                        you
                        order a
                        transcript with the second method, and when you go back and review audio of a given proceeding,
                        you
                        can hear the
                        participants' own voices and are not relying on someone else's characterization of it.</p>

                    <p>But much like the rest of technology, electronic recording is only as good as its input, so there
                        are
                        also plenty of
                        downsides to electronic recording if the people in the courtroom aren't carefully monitoring,
                        such
                        as using one mic
                        or people speaking softly while walking away from their mic, that stenographers won't have a
                        problem
                        with since
                        they're physically there. The second method requires people to be involved in the process to
                        make a
                        good audio
                        record for transcription and for the most part does not involve only machines and no humans.
